# Who We Are

Hermetic Lab specializes in transforming complex RFCs and protocols into practical, usable services. Our team combines deep expertise in cryptography, distributed systems, and software engineering with the cutting-edge capabilities of artificial intelligence.

## Our Mission

We bridge the gap between theoretical cryptographic protocols and real-world applications. Many powerful security and privacy protocols exist as academic papers or technical RFCs but lack practical implementations that developers can easily integrate into their projects.

## Our Approach

We take a hybrid approach to solving these challenges:

1. **Human Expertise**: Our team brings deep knowledge of cryptography, security protocols, and software engineering to understand the theoretical underpinnings of complex standards.

2. **AI Augmentation**: We leverage AI to accelerate development, identify edge cases, and help translate between theoretical constructs and practical implementations.

3. **Pragmatic Solutions**: We focus on creating developer-friendly APIs, comprehensive documentation, and robust implementations that prioritize both security and usability.

## Our Focus Areas

- **Secure Communication**: Implementing modern cryptographic protocols like MLS (Messaging Layer Security) for secure group messaging
- **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**: Making advanced privacy-preserving computation accessible to developers
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Building practical tools for verification without revealing sensitive information
- **Secure Distributed Systems**: Creating components for secure, decentralized applications

We're committed to maintaining the security guarantees of the original protocols while making them accessible to developers through clear APIs, comprehensive documentation, and reliable implementations.
