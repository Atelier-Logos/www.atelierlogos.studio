# Our Projects

Hermetic Lab has developed several projects focused on making complex cryptographic protocols accessible to developers. Here's an overview of our key offerings:

## Hermetic MLS

Hermetic MLS is our implementation of the [Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol](https://messaginglayersecurity.rocks/), designed for secure and efficient group messaging. MLS provides strong security guarantees for end-to-end encrypted group communication with advanced features like:

- Forward secrecy and post-compromise security
- Efficient handling of group membership changes
- Scalability to large groups with minimal overhead

Our implementation focuses on developer experience, cross-platform compatibility, and robust security. Hermetic MLS can be integrated into messaging applications, collaborative tools, and any platform requiring secure group communication.

## Hermetic FHE (Coming Soon)

Hermetic FHE is our suite of tools for working with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). FHE allows computation on encrypted data without decryption, enabling privacy-preserving analytics and processing.

Our FHE tools will include:

- Simplified APIs for common FHE operations
- Optimized implementations of FHE schemes
- Integration guides for various use cases
- Performance optimization tools

## Hermetic Cloud

Hermetic Cloud provides hosted infrastructure and API endpoints for our cryptographic services. It offers:

- Managed instances of our protocols as a service
- High availability and scalability
- Simple REST APIs for web and mobile integration
- Enterprise support options

Hermetic Cloud is ideal for teams that want to leverage our cryptographic implementations without managing the infrastructure themselves.
