# Hermetic FHE - Coming Soon

We're currently developing Hermetic FHE, our suite of tools for working with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). This page provides a preview of what's to come.

## What is FHE?

Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a revolutionary form of encryption that allows computations to be performed directly on encrypted data without requiring decryption first. This enables privacy-preserving computation where:

- Data owners can outsource computation without revealing sensitive information
- Data processors can provide services without accessing the underlying data
- Results remain encrypted and can only be decrypted by authorized parties

## Planned Features

Our Hermetic FHE toolkit will include:

- **FHE Primitives**: Core cryptographic functions for FHE operations
- **Easy-to-use APIs**: Simplified interfaces for common FHE operations
- **Performance Optimizations**: Implementation of techniques to make FHE practical
- **Integration Examples**: Sample applications showing FHE in real-world use cases
- **Cross-language Support**: Implementations in multiple programming languages

## Use Cases

FHE enables numerous privacy-preserving applications:

- **Private Machine Learning**: Training and inference on encrypted data
- **Secure Analytics**: Processing sensitive data while maintaining privacy
- **Confidential Computing**: Secure third-party computation without revealing inputs
- **Private Information Retrieval**: Querying databases without revealing the query

## Development Timeline

We're actively working on Hermetic FHE with the following timeline:

- **Q1 2024**: Library architecture and core primitives
- **Q2 2024**: Beta release with basic operations
- **Q3 2024**: Performance optimizations and extended API
- **Q4 2024**: Full release with comprehensive documentation and examples
