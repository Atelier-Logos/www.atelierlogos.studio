# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions and answers about the Ferropipe API. Can't find what you're looking for? Contact us at james@atelierlogos.studio.

## Getting Started

### What is Ferropipe?

Ferropipe is a powerful API that extracts, analyzes, and serves structured documentation data from Rust crates. It provides comprehensive information about packages from crates.io, including documentation, code examples, dependencies, and metadata.

### How do I get started?

1. [Schedule a call with us](https://cal.com/team/atelier-logos/ferropipe-intro) to get your API key
2. Choose your tier [See Pricing](/docs/pricing)
3. Make your first request using our [Getting Started guide](/docs/getting-started)

### Do I need an API key for all requests?

Yes, all API endpoints require authentication with a valid API key. This helps us provide reliable service and track usage for billing purposes.

### Can I test the API without signing up?

Yes! We offer a fairly generous free plan with 300 requests/mo that should be more than enough to allow you to test things out and see how you like the data.

## Pricing and Tiers

### How do the extraction depths differ?

**Basic**: Package information, basic documentation, repository links, and download statistics.

**Full**: Everything from Basic plus LLM-enriched interfaces and function signatures, struct definitions, code examples, and dependency analysis.

**Deep**: Everything from Full plus vulnerability and SBOM analysis, enhanced examples, cross-reference analysis, and advanced dependency mapping.

### What happens if I exceed my rate limit?

When you exceed your rate limit, subsequent requests will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response. Your rate limit resets on a rolling hourly basis. There are no overage charges - you simply need to wait or upgrade your plan.

## API Usage

### What happens if a crate doesn't exist?

You'll receive a `404 Not Found` response with a clear error message indicating the crate wasn't found in the registry.

### Can I request data for private crates?

No, Ferropipe only provides data for public crates available on crates.io. We don't have access to private repositories or crates. That may be something we implement in the future, but at this time it's not on our radar.

### How do I handle rate limits in my application?

Best practices for rate limiting:

1. **Monitor headers**: Check `X-RateLimit-Remaining` in responses
2. **Implement caching**: Store responses locally when possible
3. **Use appropriate depths**: Don't request Deep extraction if Basic meets your needs
4. **Implement backoff**: Use exponential backoff when hitting rate limits
5. **Batch requests**: Use bulk endpoints when requesting multiple crates


## Troubleshooting

### Why am I getting authentication errors?

Common authentication issues:
- **Missing API key**: Ensure you're including the `x-api-key` header
- **Invalid API key**: Check that your key is correct and active
- **Expired key**: API keys don't expire, but accounts can be suspended for violations

### The API returns empty or incomplete data for a crate. Why?

Some crates may have:
- Minimal documentation
- No examples or structured content
- Extraction limitations for complex macros or procedural code

The Deep tier provides the most comprehensive extraction and handles edge cases better.
